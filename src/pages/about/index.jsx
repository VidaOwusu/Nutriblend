            Nutriblend is an agro-processing startup dedicated to adding value
            to cashews and tiger nuts by producing high-quality dairy-free milk
            and powdered milk alternatives. Our mission is to address the
            limited availability of nutritious and affordable non-dairy options
            in Ghana, especially for individuals with lactose intolerance and
            those who prefer plant-based alternatives. Our products are
            carefully crafted to combine the nutritional benefits of cashews and
            tiger nuts, offering a wholesome alternative to traditional dairy
            products. By reducing the reliance on cashew exportation, we aim to
            boost local processing and contribute to the growing demand for
            dairy-free alternatives in Ghana.
